# Craigslist Project (Final Project for INFO290T)

The objective of the project is to understand and predict how people sell their cell phones online, using Craigslist’s data in order to know for the seller what is the best price, the best time to post an ad on Craigslist given his/her location, by answering the following questions:
  - How long does it take on average to make a sale given the model of phone and the location?
  - What are the main criteria which determine if a sale is likely to happen? 
  - Is Craigslist more expensive/cheaper than other second hand retailers?
  - Where are the phones the most expensive in the US?
  - Which region (in the US) has the biggest market?
  - Can we predict how likely a particular ad is going to be a sale?
Thus, if sellers on Craigslist understand the above discoveries, then they can more optimally sell their phone at a certain price and time based on their given location.
In order to do so, we will get the data by scraping the Craigslist’s website and visualize and analyze it to find patterns that could apply on selling on this very liquid second-hand market. We only focus on one type of phones which are the iPhones as they are the main market for phones and there are many types of models.
